# Environment Setup and Runtime

## 1. Create a Python Virtual Environment
## 2. Install required libraries
We will assume you are using `mkvirtualenv` command to manage your virtual environments. Once you ativate your virtual environment, run the following command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
## 3. Sort Testing Media
The directory `media` will hold all audio for the exercise. Ideally got to YouTube and download some clips (audio-only) to for testing and drop them into `media/demo` sub-directory. Create the `demo` sub-directory.

When done with above preparations, run the following command: `python sortmedia.py`
