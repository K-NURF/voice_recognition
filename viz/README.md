# Why Streamlit for ML Visualizations?
`Streamlit` is an open-source framework designed to create data science web applications quickly and easily. It's especially well-suited for tasks like `model visualization` because:

1. **Rapid Development:** You can build and deploy apps with just a few lines of Python code.
2. **Interactivity:** `Streamlit` makes it easy to add interactive widgets like sliders, dropdowns, and file uploaders, allowing users to experiment with different models and datasets.
3. **Visualization-First Approach:** It integrates seamlessly with popular libraries like `Matplotlib, Seaborn,` and `Plotly`, making it simple to generate insightful `charts` and `graphs`.

These features make `Streamlit` an ideal tool for visualizing classification algorithms, allowing users to understand models by observing their behavior in real time.
